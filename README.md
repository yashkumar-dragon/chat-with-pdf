Chat with PDF Application

Introduction

The Chat with PDF Application is an interactive tool that allows users to upload PDF documents, extract their content, and interact with the document's content using a question-answering system powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). The app provides a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit or Chainlit and supports efficient handling of large PDFs by splitting the text into manageable chunks for embedding and querying.

Key Features:

PDF Upload: Users can upload single or multiple PDF files.

Text Extraction: Extract text from PDFs using libraries like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber.

Embedding Generation: Convert extracted text into embeddings using OpenAI or Sentence Transformers.

Question Answering: Ask context-aware questions about the PDF content, with answers generated by GPT-3.5 or Hugging Face models.

Bonus Features:

Highlight relevant sections in the original PDF.

Cross-document querying for multiple PDFs.
